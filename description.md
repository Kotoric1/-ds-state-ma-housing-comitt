# Group 2

### Potential Project Goals:
- Based on eviction rates and per capita evictions, compare Massachusetts to other states, Boston to other major cities, and / or Massachusetts counties.
    - Correlate potentially relevant demographic, economic, and policy factors between states / cities / countieswith evictions  and perform causal inference.
    - Determine statistical significance of evictions in small population groups, where necessary (i.e. identify outliers).

- Model trends in Massachusetts evictions over time on state, city or county level 
    - Correlate with potentially relevant trends in demographic and economic factors or policy changes
    - Predict future trends in evictions (to identify where they are getting better or worse)

### Potential Limitations:
- Reliability of tenant expectations for eviction (Census Household Pulse Survey)
- Ability to identify and classify policy factors
- Frequency / time scale of available data points (primarily for time series modelling)
- Availability of city or county specific data
- Reliability of eviction counts
